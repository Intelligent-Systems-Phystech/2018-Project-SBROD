  abstract =	"Structural bioinformatics is of great necessity to the
		 study of mechanisms of molecular machinery in the
		 biological processes. It applies statistical and
		 mathematical modeling to solve problems in protein
		 folding, protein structure prediction and
		 protein-protein interactions. Amongst the various
		 issues in structural bioinformatics, scoring function
		 is a very important one because it is the core of many
		 algorithms. In this thesis, scoring function
		 optimization and weight training problems are
		 investigated in three related works: (1) Quality
		 Assessment of Protein Structure Model: Knowing the
		 resolution and accuracy of the structure model is
		 crucial for biologists to determine its usage. Various
		 quality assessment scores are combined using linear,
		 logistic and LOESS regressions to predict the quality
		 of the structure model in terms of RMSD and
		 correct/incorrect categories. Local quality of the
		 structure, in terms of C{$\alpha$} distance, is also
		 modeled using simple regression and hierarchical
		 approaches. Finally, the developed regression equations
		 are applied to assess quality of structure models of
		 the whole E.coli proteome. (2) Optimizing Scoring
		 Function for Ranking Protein Docking Conformations:
		 Numerous metrics that measure the goodness of the
		 docking scoring function are used to optimize our
		 scoring function that is a linear combination of 9
		 energetic terms and the weights are optimized by
		 logistic regression and Genetic Algorithm. By cross
		 comparison, different metrics are shown to have
		 different generalization ability. The resulting scoring
		 functions are then compared to ZRANK and ZDOCK on a
		 benchmark data set and show substantial improvement.
		 Finally ensemble approaches are employed and
		 improvement is observed on several metrics. (3)
		 Threading without Optimizing Weighting Factor for
		 Scoring Function: A simple gapless threading system
		 with two energy terms is used to test several novel
		 methods which do not require training weights on a
		 training set. Basic ideas of these methods is to sample
		 different values of the weight and select an optimal
		 template structure for a target sequence by examining
		 the characteristics of the distribution of scores
		 computed by varying the weight. An artificial neural
		 network model is also built to predict target-specific
		 weight based on the features of protein sequence.
		 Finally, it is shown that the novel approaches combined
		 with the traditional methods can increase the
		 predicting power of the scoring function.^",

		 structures of protein-protein complexes based on the
		 structure of individual partners. Docking protocols
		 usually include several steps of sampling, clustering,
		 refinement and re-scoring. The scoring step is one of
		 the bottlenecks in the performance of many
		 state-of-the-art protocols. The performance of scoring
		 functions depends on the quality of the generated
		 structures and its coupling to the sampling algorithm.
		 A tool kit, GRADSCOPT (GRid Accelerated Directly

		 atomistic and coarse-grained potentials can be created
		 by a grid-accelerated directly scoring dependent
		 Monte-Carlo annealing or by a linear regression
		 optimization. We demonstrate that the scoring functions
		 generated by our approach are similar to or even
		 outperform state-of-the-art scoring functions for
		 predicting near-native solutions. Of additional
		 importance, we find that potentials specifically
		 trained to identify the native bound complex perform
		 rather poorly on identifying acceptable or medium

		 long-range contact potentials can increase the average

		 We described comprehensive tests of the effectiveness

  abstract =	"Molecular interaction among proteins drives the
		 cellular processes through the formation of complexes
		 that perform the requisite biochemical function. While
		 some of the complexes are obligate (i.e., they fold
		 together while complexation) others are non-obligate,
		 and are formed through macromolecular recognition.
		 Macromolecular recognition in proteins is highly
		 specific, yet it can be both permanent and non
		 permanent in nature. Hallmarks of permanent recognition
		 complexes include large surface of interaction,
		 stabilization by hydrophobic interaction and other
		 noncovalent forces. Several amino acids which
		 contribute critically to the free energy of binding at
		 these interfaces are called as {"}hot spot{"} residues.
		 The non permanent recognition complexes, on the other
		 hand, usually show small interface of interaction, with
		 limited stabilization from non covalent forces. For
		 both the permanent and non permanent complexes, the
		 specificity of molecular interaction is governed by the
		 geometric compatibility of the interaction surface, and
		 the noncovalent forces that anchor them. A great deal
		 of studies has already been performed in understanding
		 the basis of protein macromolecular recognition.1; 2
		 Based on these studies efforts have been made to
		 develop protein-protein docking algorithms that can
		 predict the geometric orientation of the interacting
		 molecules from their individual unbound states. Despite
		 advances in docking methodologies, several significant
		 difficulties remain.1 Therefore, in this thesis, we
		 start with literature review to understand the
		 individual merits and demerits of the existing
		 approaches (Chapter 1),3 and then, we attempt to
		 address some of the problems by developing methods to
		 infer protein quaternary structure from the crystalline
		 state, and improve structural and chemical
		 understanding of protein-protein interactions through
		 biological complex prediction. The understanding of the
		 interaction geometry is the first step in a
		 protein-protein interaction study. Yet, no consistent
		 method exists to assess the geometric compatibility of
		 the interacting interface because of its highly rugged
		 nature. This suggested that new sensitive measures and
		 methods are needed to tackle the problem. We,
		 therefore, developed two new and conceptually different
		 measures using the Delaunay tessellation and interface
		 slice selection to compute the surface complementarity
		 and atom packing at the protein-protein interface
		 (Chapter 2).4 We called these Normalized Surface
		 Complementarity (NSc) and Normalized Interface Packing
		 (NIP). We rigorously benchmarked the measures on the
		 non redundant protein complexes available in the
		 Protein Data Bank (PDB) and found that they efficiently
		 segregate the biological protein-protein contacts from
		 the non biological ones, especially those derived from
		 X-ray crystallography. Sensitive surface
		 packing/complementarity recognition algorithms are
		 usually computationally expensive and thus limited in
		 application to high-throughput screening. Therefore,
		 special emphasis was given to make our measure
		 compute-efficient as well. Our final evaluation showed
		 that NSc, and NIP have very strong correlation among
		 themselves, and with the interface area normalized
		 values available from the Surface Complementarity
		 program (CCP4 Suite:
		 <http://smb.slac.stanford.edu/facilities/software/ccp4/html/sc.html>;);
		 but at a fraction of the computing cost. After building
		 the geometry based surface complementarity and packing
		 assessment methods to assess the rugged protein
		 surface, we advanced our goal to determine the
		 stabilities of the geometrically compatible interfaces
		 formed. For doing so, we needed to survey the
		 quaternary structure of proteins with various
		 affinities. The emphasis on affinity arose due to its
		 strong relationship with the permanent and non
		 permanent life-time of the complex. We, therefore, set
		 up data mining studies on two databases named PQS
		 (Protein Quaternary structure database:
		 http://pqs.ebi.ac.uk) and PISA (Protein Interfaces,
		 Surfaces and Assemblies:
		 www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/prot_int/pistart.html) that offered
		 downloads on quaternary structure data on protein
		 complexes derived from X-ray crystallographic methods.
		 To our surprise, we found that above mentioned
		 databases provided the valid quaternary structure
		 mostly for moderate to strong affinity complexes. The
		 limitation could be ascertained by browsing annotations
		 from another curated database of protein quaternary
		 structure (PiQSi:5
		 supfam.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/elevy/piqsi/piqsi_home.cgi)
		 and literature surveys. This necessitated that we at
		 first develop a more robust method to infer quaternary
		 structures of all affinity available from the PDB. We,
		 therefore, developed a new scheme focused on covering
		 all affinity category complexes, especially the
		 weak/very weak ones, and heteromeric quaternary
		 structures (Chapter 3).6 Our scheme combined the
		 na{\"i}ve Bayes classifier and point-group symmetry
		 under a Boolean framework to detect all categories of
		 protein quaternary structures in crystal lattice. We
		 tested it on a standard benchmark consisting of 112
		 recognition heteromeric complexes, and obtained a
		 correct recall in 95\% cases, which are significantly
		 better than 53\% achieved by the PISA,7 a state-of-art
		 quaternary structure detection method hosted at the
		 European Bioinformatics Institute, Hinxton, UK. A few
		 cases that failed correct detection through our scheme,
		 offered interesting insights into the intriguing nature
		 of protein contacts in the lattice. The findings have
		 implications for accurate inference of quaternary
		 states of proteins, especially weak affinity complexes,
		 where biological protein contacts tend to be sacrificed
		 for the energetically optimal ones that favor the
		 formation/stabilization of the crystal lattice. We
		 expect our method to be used widely by all researchers
		 interested in protein quaternary structure and
		 interaction. Having developed a method that allows us
		 to sample all categories of quaternary structures in
		 PDB, we set our goal in addressing the next problem
		 that of accurately determining stabilities of the
		 geometrically compatible protein surfaces involved in
		 interaction. Reformulating the question in terms of
		 protein-protein docking, we sought to ask how we could
		 reliably infer the stabilities of any arbitrary
		 interface that is formed when two protein molecules are
		 brought sterically closer. In a real protein docking
		 exercise this question is asked innumerable times
		 during energy-based screening of thousands of decoys
		 geometrically sampled (through rotation+translation)
		 from the unbound subunits. The current docking methods
		 face problems in two counts: (i), the number of
		 interfaces from decoys to evaluate energies is rather
		 large (64320 for a 9{\textordmasculine} rotation and
		 translation for a dimeric complex), and (ii) the energy
		 based screening is not quite efficient such that the
		 decoys with native-like quaternary structure are rarely
		 selected at high ranks. We addressed both the problems
		 with interesting results. Intricate decoy filtering
		 approaches have been developed, which are either
		 applied during the search stage or the sampling stage,
		 or both. For filtering, usually statistical
		 information, such as 3D conservation information of the
		 interfacial residues, or similar facts is used; more
		 expensive approaches screen for orientation, shape
		 complementarity and electrostatics. We developed an
		 interface area based decoy filter for the sampling
		 stage, exploiting an assumption that native-like decoys
		 must have the largest, or close to the largest,
		 interface (Chapter 4).8 Implementation of this
		 assumption and standard benchmarking showed that in
		 91\% of the cases, we could recover native-like decoys
		 of bound and unbound binary docking-targets of both
		 strong and weak affinity. This allowed us to propose
		 that {"}native-like decoys must have the largest, or
		 close to the largest, interface{"} can be used as a
		 rule to exclude non native decoys efficiently during
		 docking sampling. This rule can dramatically clip the
		 needle-in-a-haystack problem faced in a docking study
		 by reducing >95\% of the decoy set available from
		 sampling search. We incorporated the rule as a central
		 part of our protein docking strategy. While addressing
		 the question of energy based screening to rank the
		 native-like decoys at high rank during docking, we came
		 across a large volume of work already published. The
		 mainstay of most of the energy based screenings that
		 avoid statistical potential, involve some form of the
		 Coulomb{'}s potential, Lennard Jones potential and
		 solvation energy. Different flavors of the energy
		 functions are used with diverse preferences and weights
		 for individual terms. Interestingly, in all cases the
		 energy functions were of the unnormalized form.
		 Individual energy terms were simply added to arrive at
		 a final score that was to be used for ranking. Proteins
		 being large molecules, offer limited scope of applying
		 semi-empirical or quantum mechanical methods for large
		 scale evaluation of energy. We, therefore, developed a
		 de novo empirical scoring function in the normalized
		 form. As already stated, we found NSc and NIP to be
		 highly discriminatory for segregating biological and
		 non biological interface. We, therefore, incorporated
		 them as parameters for our scoring function. Our data
		 mining study revealed that there is a reasonable
		 correlation of -0.73 between normalized solvation
		 energy and normalized nonbonding energy (Coulombs + van
		 der Waals) at the interface. Using the information, we
		 extended our scoring function by combining the
		 geometric measures and the normalized interaction
		 energies. Tests on 30 unbound binary protein-protein
		 complexes showed that in 16 cases we could identify at
		 least one decoy in top three ranks with {$\leq$}10
		 {\AA} backbone root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) from
		 true binding geometry. The scoring results were
		 compared with other state-of-art methods, which
		 returned inferior results. The salient feature of our
		 scoring function was exclusion of any experiment guided
		 restraints, evolutionary information, statistical
		 propensities or modified interaction energy equations,
		 commonly used by others. Tests on 118 less difficult
		 bound binary protein-protein complexes with
		 {$\leq$}35\% sequence redundancy at the interface gave
		 first rank in 77\% cases, where the native like decoy
		 was chosen among 1 in 10,000 and had {$\leq$}5 {\AA}
		 backbone RMSD from true geometry. The details about the
		 scoring function, results and comparison with the other
		 methods are extensively discussed in Chapter 5.9 The
		 method has been implemented and made available for
		 public use as a web server - PROBE
		 (http://pallab.serc.iisc.ernet.in/probe). The
		 development and use of PROBE has been elaborated in
		 Chapter 7.10 On course of this work, we generated huge
		 amounts of data, which is useful information that could
		 be used by others, especially {"}protein dockers{"}.
		 We, therefore, developed dockYard
		 (http://pallab.serc.iisc.ernet.in/dockYard) - a
		 repository for protein-protein docking decoys (Chapter
		 6).11 dockYard offers four categories of docking decoys
		 derived from: Bound (native dimer co-crystallized),
		 Unbound (individual subunits as well as the target are
		 crystallized), Variants (match the previous two
		 categories in at least one subunit with 100\% sequence
		 identity), and Interlogs (match the previous categories
		 in at least one subunit with {$\geq$}90\% or
		 {$\geq$}50\% sequence identity). There is facility for
		 full or selective download based on search parameters.
		 The portal also serves as a repository to modelers who
		 may want to share their decoy sets with the community.
		 In conclusion, although we made several contributions
		 in development of algorithms for improved
		 protein-protein docking and quaternary structure
		 inference, a lot of challenges remain (Chapter 8). The
		 principal challenge arises by considering proteins as
		 flexible bodies, whose conformational states may change
		 on quaternary structure formation. In addition, solvent
		 plays a major role in the free energy of binding, but
		 its exact contribution is not straightforward to
		 estimate. Undoubtedly, the cost of computation is one
		 of the limiting factors apart from good energy
		 functions to evaluate the docking decoys. Therefore,
		 the next generation of algorithms must focus on
		 improved docking studies that realistically incorporate
		 flexibility and solvent environment in all their
		 evaluations.",
